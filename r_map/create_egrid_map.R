# read in eGRID subregion shapefile 
# The original eGRID shapefile can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/energy/download-egrid2014-shapefiles
# Those shapefiles are problematic for plotting the contiguous US for a few reasons: 
# 1. parts of Alaska are on the Eastern Hemisphere, so 2-D maps show the entire world
# 2. the maps are incredibly large, leading to slow plot times and large file sizes
# In egrid_shpfiles_edit I have removed the parts of the shapefile in the eastern Hemisphere using ArcGIS (ArcMap I think)
# In the egrid_shpfiles_edit_simple, I have simplified the shapefile on the website mapshaper.org 
# Typically I simplify to about 10%, using default settings and checking "prevent shape removal"
# Each simple folder is a simplification of the previous simple folder. 
# i.e. simple2 is the simplified file from simple
# Therefore, simple 3 has been simplified 3 times. 
# I find this leads to fast plotting times (around 3 seconds) without losing too much resolution on the map
